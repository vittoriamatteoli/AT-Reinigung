Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

# My boyfriend own a cleaning company and dosn't have a website yet because he never needed. I wanted to use this opportunity to experience coding on this project and at the end I could make it live if I like the result.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## For the second part of the Project I've struggled a bit since I didn't start project 1 "mobile-first". I ended up changing a lot in the structure of my code . I had to change displaying conditions to flex and reorganize the all loyouts. It came out fully responsive ! I will now focus on P3 and make my form working .
